    The animated series, produced by Marvel and Sunbow, began with two groups of 18 of Autobot, and 10 Decepticons who wanted to plunder the resources of earth. In the first season the Autobots outnumbered the Decepticons, so they had their ranks bolstered by loads of generic jets, called the Seekers and ground troopers based on Decepticon spy Reflector called Photons. Starring Autobots of the first season were Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Jazz, Ironhide, Brawn, Prowl, Hound, and the twins Sideswipe and Sunstreaker. While the Decepticons starred Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave and his cassette minions, Reflector, Skywarp, And Thundercracker. The main story lines of this first season saw the Decepticons attempt to enslave all of humanity, revive and manipulate the gentle giant Skyfire, try to trick the gullible Dinobots into destroying the Autobots, and the Decepticons constructed the first combiner, a Transformer made up of 6 component robots, Devastator. Ultimately culminating in all the Decepticons being thrown into a chasm of lava and disappearing. This first season was a groundbreaking success, topping the charts of 80s children’s television. Which after only 3 episodes, led to a second season being greenlit.

    Season 2 introduced a whole new slew of characters whose toys had come out that year in 1985, there was no explanation as to where these new characters had come from. Important new Autobots were Scientist Perceptor, communications officer Blaster, pacifist Geologist Beachcomber, firefighters Inferno and Red Alert, architects Hoist and Grapple, and the Autobots last line of defense, Omega Supreme. The only new notable Decepticons were the Triple Changers Astrotrain and Blitzwing, who had two vehicle modes, and the Conehead jets Ramjet, Dirge, And Thrust, who mainly served as cannon fodder during battles due to the generics of Season 1 being retired. The biggest stories of this season were the Dinobot stories where they abandoned the weakened Autobots but ultimately helped save them. And the other one where they helped stop the Decepticons from draining an island inhabited by Dinosaurs of its energy. The season ended with the new 1986 toys being showcased, 4 Combiner teams. The autobot jets, the Aerialbots, The Autobot search and rescue unit, the Protectobots, the decepticon rulers of the road, the Stunticons, and the elite battle squadron, the Combaticons. After this, later that summer, The Transformers: The Movie came out in theatres. It Debuted most of the new 1986 characters as well as introducing the new female Autobot Arcee, as well as the monster planet Unicron. this marked the end of the golden era of Transformers television as a new studio loomed over the thriving television show. This also marked the death of Optimus Prime and Megatron, and rise of Rodimus Prime and Galvatron

    Studio company AKOM aquired the license to produce the Transformers Cartoon, but they ended up tarnishing the once great show with many budget cuts, which resulted in poor animation choices, which including Decepticons being depicted among the Autobot ranks, and other countless errors. While introducing the new toys of 1986 and 1987, they had some of the worst episodes to ever air from Transformers with the atrocities “Carnage in C-Minor” and “The Face of the Nijika”, which are two of the worst episodes to come out of the entire show. They also decided that since Optimus Prime was killed in the movie they should bring him back as a reanimated zombie who ultimately ended up dying again. The Fourth Season was cut down to three episodes due to Marvel canceling their contract with Hasbro because of the terrible ratings from Season 3. The series culminated in the three parter, “The Rebirth”. After this Transformers animation layed low until a new hope in the mid 90s, but that is a story for another day.
