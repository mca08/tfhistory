    Bob Budiansky wrote issues 1-56 of the American comic. Throughout his time as writer, he introduced new concepts and ideas that would be used in Transformers media today. He had a lot to work into the story, with the constant slew of new characters coming in, the cast was expanding at alarming rates. So in issue 11, he made his first deck claering issue, which took out most of the Autobot cast of 1984, by having them be killed by a Decepticon controlled copy of Optimus Prime, in order to make room for the new 1985 and 1986 characters hitting toy shelves. Just 8 issues later in issue 19, he took out all but 3 of the 1984 Decepticons. With them all being easily deactivated by the Autobot’s last line of defense, Omega Supreme. He later brought back all these characters in issue 41 only for the climax in issue 50 to be devastating, The story arc is based upon a ultimate Cybertronian database called the Underbase, which was jettisoned off Cybertron before the Autobots and Decepticons arrived on Earth. When word came the Underbase was coming to Earth, one of the resurrected Decepticons, Starscream, sought out the power for himself, so he pitted the Autobots and Decepticons into battle while he obtained the Underbase. While only basking in its power for a moment, it was enough power to wipe out countless Autobots and Decepticons who attempted to foil his plot to conquer Earth. Ultimately the power was too much for Starscream, and when he absorbed the rest of the Underbase, he blew up into a ball of flames and his body plummeted to Earth. In the aftermath of the battle, new Decepticon leader Scorponok, and Optimus Prime laid down their arms for a limited time to recover the victims of Starscream’s rampage. In all, 79 characters whose toys had been discontinued by 1988 perished. after this there were 5 more stories starring the new Pretenders and Micromasters. When Budiansky finally retired from his reign, he passed the torch onto British writer Simon Furman, who had been writing all of the United Kingdom stories up to this point, and now wrote the American comics as well.

    When Furman took control of the American comic, one of the first things he did was take many aspects of his work in the United Kingdom and transferred those ideas into the American comic. The biggest of those being the monster planet Unicron, whose greatest enemy Primus, turned his body into the planet Cybertron. The stories went on as usual for a while, with key stories of his being the Autobot detective Nightbeat solving a string of murders, the tyrannical Decepticon Thunderwing leading a group of Decepticons in obtaining Optimus Prime's Matrix of Leadership, and Galvatron being shot into a black hole after being bested in combat by the Autobot black ops unit, The Wreckers. When Unicron sent his minions to attack Cybertron, Scorponok's fear of death made him make a deal with Optimus Prime to call a truce to kill the dark god. After learning of this truce, Decepticon Shockwave usurped command from Scorponok and created Decepticon Civil War. The battle was cut short by the arrival of Unicron who began ripping apart Cybertron. The battle was intense leaving many unfortunate victims, with Thunderwing being eaten alive, Shockwave having a building collapse on him, Scorponok being obliterated by an eye beam, and Optimus Prime giving his life to destroy Unicron with the Matrix of Leadership. After the battle the fight still wasn’t over, with Decepticon shock trooper Runamuck being dragged to his death by surviving Unicron minions and Decepticon Bludgeon, in the wake of Scorponok's death, declaring himself Decepticon leader and waging war on the survivng Autobots being led by Grimlock. When the arrogant Grimlock attempted to charge Bludgeon head on, it resulted in almost every Autobot being killed in an ambush, only 6 Autobots survived the ambush and blamed Grimlock, but when all hope seemed lost, the mysterious Last Autobot came and resurrected Optimus Prime to finish the fight. After Bludgeon and the Decepticons were defeated and exiled, the war was over and the Autobots could return home. With the Last Autobot restoring all of the fallen Autobots, the Autobots could finally go home at last. Until Generation 2, but we don’t talk about Generation 2.
