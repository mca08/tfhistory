                The Transformers was a Hasbro toyline that ran from 1984-1993. The main idea for the Tranformers was taken from Japanese toy company TakaraTomy, whose toyline Diaclone was having trouble finding a market in the U.S. While a Hasbro representative was at a Tokyo toy show, he managed to acquire the license. When the toys were imported to the U.S., Bob Budiansky and Jim Shooter came up with new personalities for the characters, and depicted them as aliens, coming from the planet Cybertron. The toyline was a smash hit success, with the comic and cartoon given more issues and episodes to make.

                The Transformers is about two warring factions of robots from the planet Cybertron. There is the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the evil Decepticons, led by The tyranical Megatron.  The main reason for coming to Earth in both the comics and the TV show was that they were on a mission to find more of the life giving Energon that powered the Transformers. When the Decepticons crashed the Autobot shuttle, The Ark, on Earth 4 million years ago. The Transformers awoke in modern day 1984, The Decepticons set out to plunder Earth's resources, and the Autobots mobilized to stop them. The Comics were split into two eras, the first was the era of Bob Budiansky whos era ran from issue 1-55 was more about the repercussions of war and humanities distrust of Autobot and Decepticon alike. The second era by Simon Furman from issue 56-80 explored the origins of the Transformers and culminated in a battle against the planet destroying Transformer, Unicron. The cartoon also had two eras, The first was the era of Sunbow productions, who did the first two seasons of the Cartoon, which followed the Autobots foiling many Decepticons schemes to destroy the Autobots and claim Earthâ€™s resources. The second era of the cartoon was by AKOM, which was a quality downgrade with many animation errors. The plot was about the Decepticons, having been defeated in the movie, attempting to seize back control of Cybertron from the Autobots while dealing with many internal issues of their own.
